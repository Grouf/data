First of all Great Axe has several Darkness skillchains combination and kinda potent ones too:
Upheaval or Armor Break > Steel Cyclone > Upheaval > Steel Cyclone is 4 step darkness

Also few more relevant ones:

Dagger:
Mordant > Mordant > Evisceration gives darkness. Adding Rudra is double darkness

Katana:
Teki > To > Teki > Shun is Light. With Aeonic you can add Shun for 5 step Radiance or 
	cut first Teki and do the same for 3 step light or 4 step Radiance

Sword:
Savage > KotR > CDC or KotR is 3 step double light. You can add Requiescat on start to make it 4 step
Savage or Death Blossom > CDC or Death Blossom > Requiescat is 3 step Darkness. With aeonic you can add 
	another Requiescat for 4 step Umbra
Red Lotus > Flat Blade > Requiescat > Expiacion is 4step Darkness

H2H:
Tornado > Shijin > Shijin is 3 step light. Can add another Shijin with Aeonic for 4 step Radiance and 
	also Shijin before Tornado for 4 step light and 5 step Radiance

Great Katana:
Tachi: Yukikaze / Tachi: Jinpu -> Tachi: Ageha -> Tachi: Shoha -> Tachi: Kasha -> Tachi: Fudo for double light
Or
Tachi: Yukikaze / Tachi: Jinpu -> Tachi: Ageha -> Tachi: Fudo for Darkness.
Or
Tachi: Ageha > Tachi: Enpi > Tachi: Enpi > Tachi: Kasha > Tachi: Shoha > Tachi: Fudo for double light.
or
Tachi: Rana > Tachi: Fudo > Tachi: Kasha > Tachi: Shoha > Tachi: Fudo
--------------------------------
Fudo + fudo = light
Kasha + shoha + fudo = light light
Rana + shoha + kasha + fudo = Fragmentation light light
Fudo + kasha + shoha + fudo = fusion light light
Shoha + fudo + kasha + shoha + fudo = distortion fusion light light (With Aeonic can do Shoha as well at end for Radiance.)
Rana + shoha + fudo + kasha + shoha + fudo = fragmentation distortion fusion light light
